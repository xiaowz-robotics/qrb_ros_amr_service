# qrb_ros_amr_service

qrb_ros_amr_service is a package to manage the AMR behavior, such as navigation, mapping, return charging station.

## Overview

Qualcomm amr service provides ROS interfaces that application can use these interfaces to start a P2P navigation or
Follow path, amr service will control the base return the charging station when battery level is low.

qrb_amr_manager, which is a dynamic library, it manages the amr behavior.

## Build

Currently, we only support use QCLINUX to build

1. Setup environments follow this document 's [Set up the cross-compile environment.](https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/80-65220-2/develop-your-first-application_6.html?product=1601111740013072&facet=Qualcomm%20Intelligent%20Robotics%20(QIRP)%20Product%20SDK&state=releasecandidate) part

2. Create `ros_ws` directory in `<qirp_decompressed_workspace>/qirp-sdk/`

3. Clone this repository under `<qirp_decompressed_workspace>/qirp-sdk/ros_ws`
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/qualcomm-qrb-ros/qrb_ros_interfaces.git
     git clone https://github.com/qualcomm-qrb-ros/qrb_ros_amr_service.git
     ```
4. Build this project
     ```bash
     export AMENT_PREFIX_PATH="${OECORE_TARGET_SYSROOT}/usr;${OECORE_NATIVE_SYSROOT}/usr"
     export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${OECORE_TARGET_SYSROOT}/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages
     export Python3_NumPy_INCLUDE_DIR=${OECORE_TARGET_SYSROOT}/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/numpy/core/include
     colcon build --merge-install --cmake-args \
       -DPython3_NumPy_INCLUDE_DIR=${Python3_NumPy_INCLUDE_DIR} \
       -DPYTHON_SOABI=cpython-310-aarch64-linux-gnu \
       -DCMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX=$(pwd)/install \
       -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$(pwd)/install/share \
       -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
     ```
5. Push to the device & Install
     ```bash
     cd `<qirp_decompressed_workspace>/qirp-sdk/ros_ws/install`
     tar czvf qrb_ros_amr_service.tar.gz lib share
     scp qrb_ros_amr_service.tar.gz root@[ip-addr]:/opt/
     ssh root@[ip-addr]
     (ssh) tar -zxf /opt/qrb_ros_amr_service.tar.gz -C /opt/qcom/qirp-sdk/usr/
     ```

## Run

This package supports running it directly from the command or by dynamically adding it to the ros2 component container.

a.Run with command

1. Source this file to set up the environment on your device:
    ```bash
    ssh root@[ip-addr]
    (ssh) export HOME=/opt
    (ssh) source /opt/qcom/qirp-sdk/qirp-setup.sh
    (ssh) export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=xx
    (ssh) source /usr/bin/ros_setup.bash
    ```

2. Use this command to run this package
    ```bash
    (ssh) ros2 launch qrb_ros_amr qrb_ros_amr_bringup.launch.py
    ```
